**The Feature Type**
What type of feature is it that you want to be added? Is it a quality of life feature or a feature to make the game feel more 3D?
Please do not send a request to add a new gamemode, new icons (for all gamemodes) or new levels because that is pretty much 100% expected to be something I add. A request that is way too big will also be out of the scope for this game, so no level editor, online features and stuff like that.

**The Feature**
A nice, clear and concise description of what the feature should do or should add.

**Mock Ups**
If you have the time, maybe make a mock up sketch of the feature. This will help me in understanding what you want to be added but it's not needed.

**Extra Info I Should Know About**
Add any other information I should know about here.
