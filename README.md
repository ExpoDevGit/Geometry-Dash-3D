# Geometry Dash 3D
Basically, it's Geometry Dash but in 3D (obviously)

I *WILL* (probably) make a youtube video about how I made this game and this github repository is here cuz version control is good.

Buy normal geometry dash and support the creator:

# Game Plan
These things below are what I plan on creating for this game.

**Levels from the orignal game but in 3D:**
- Stereo madness
- Back on track
- Polargeist
- Dry out

**Gamemodes from the orignal game:**
- Cube (FINISHED)
- Ship (WORKING ON CURRENTLY)

I might add more in the future but currently this is all that I have planned for the video.
