# Geometry Dash 3D
Basically, it's Geometry Dash but in 3D.

I *WILL* (probably) make a youtube video about how I made this game and this github repository is here cuz version control is good.

Buy normal geometry dash and support the creator:

# How To Open The Project
**Step 1**
Make sure you have Unity 2020.3.30f1 installed (you can obviously use another version but this is the version I used).

**Step 2**
Download or clone the repository to your local device. Remember where you saved the project and make sure it's unzipped but you probably already know to do that.

**Step 3**
Open Unity Hub.

**Step 4**
Press "Add" on the projects tab in Unity Hub, then find where you saved the project and add the folder to Unity Hub.

**Step 5**
Open the project and wait for it to load.

**Step 6**
You're now finished and ready to modify the game in whichever way you want! :)

# Game Plan
These things below are what I plan on creating for this game.

**Levels from the orignal game but in 3D:**
- Stereo madness
- Back on track
- Polargeist
- Dry out

**Gamemodes from the orignal game:**
- Cube (FINISHED)
- Ship (FINISHED)

I might add more in the future but currently this is all that I have planned for the video.
